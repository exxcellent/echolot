The MIT License is recommended for most projects. 
It is simple and easy to understand and it places almost 
no restrictions on what you can do with a jQuery project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free 
to use a jQuery project under that license.

You don’t have to do anything special to choose one 
license or the other and you don’t have to notify anyone 
which license you are using. You are free to use a 
jQuery project in commercial projects as long as the 
copyright header is left intact.
